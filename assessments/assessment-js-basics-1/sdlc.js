const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step involves figuring out who the audience is and how do you gain competitive advantage in addressing the audience."
const design = "This step requires getting approvals from people about the ideas that will be built into final product"
const implementation = "This is the part where coding happens. We apply ideas into code."
const testingIntegration = "Test to see if the new code built will work with anything built previously."
const maintain = "Once product has been delivered any tasks regarding the project is considered maintenance."
